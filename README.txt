In this project I will create random quotes and assign a random famous person to it.

Here are a few possible quote structres:

The sentence starts with a observation or an Emotion, Action or Question. It can then be followed by an Action or Observation.
If the second choice is an action the code will choose whether to add an observation to the end. It is then finished off by a random famous persons name.

Question - Action - By
Why is the sky blue? Go for a run - Abraham Lincoln

Emotion - Observation - Action - By
When feeling down -
